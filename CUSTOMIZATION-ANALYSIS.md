# Home Services Theme - Electrical Services Customization

## Analysis & Fixes Applied

### Issues Found & Fixed:

#### 1. **Hardcoded Testimonials (Fixed)**
- **Problem:** The homepage had hardcoded testimonials with fake names and locations (Sarah Johnson from Manhattan, Mike Rodriguez from Brooklyn, Lisa Chen from Queens)
- **Solution:** Updated `layouts/index.html` to use testimonials data from your `_index.md` content file
- **Result:** Now displays real testimonials from Gharsana customers (Rahul Sharma, Anita Gupta, Sanjay Patel)

#### 2. **Wrong Service Categories in Navigation (Fixed)**
- **Problem:** Navigation dropdown showed dental services (general-dentistry, cosmetic-dentistry, orthodontics, oral-surgery)
- **Solution:** Updated `layouts/partials/navigation.html` to show electrical services (electrical-installation, electrical-panel-upgrade, lighting-installation)
- **Result:** Navigation now matches your electrical services

#### 3. **Generic Service Listings (Fixed)**
- **Problem:** Homepage was trying to pull services from file pages but not using your structured data
- **Solution:** Updated homepage to use `featured_services` data from your `_index.md` content
- **Result:** Displays your 6 electrical services with proper icons, descriptions, and pricing

#### 4. **Missing Content Integration (Fixed)**
- **Problem:** Layout wasn't using the rich data structure from your content files
- **Solution:** Added sections for:
  - Featured services with emergency badges
  - "Why Choose Us" section using your `why_choose_us` data
  - Service areas highlight using your `service_areas_highlight` data
  - Team members using your `team_members` data
  - FAQs using your `faqs` data

#### 5. **Generic Hero Section (Fixed)**
- **Problem:** Hero section used generic site parameters
- **Solution:** Updated to prioritize content-specific parameters from `_index.md`
- **Result:** Shows your specific hero title, subtitle, and contact information

#### 6. **Incorrect Footer Information (Fixed)**
- **Problem:** Footer had generic contact info and hours
- **Solution:** Updated footer to use your contact information and add emergency hours
- **Result:** Shows your Gharsana address, phone, email, and 24/7 emergency availability

### New Features Added:

#### 1. **Service Areas Section**
- Displays your service area highlights (Gharsana Town, Nagrayan, Bada Bazar)
- Shows local phone numbers for each area
- Links to full service area page

#### 2. **Enhanced Team Display**
